        <h1>Space is awesome!</h1>
        <p>This is a selection of pictures about space because it's incredible and awe-inspiring to watch. Did you know that the Voyager spacecrafts have been travelling for more than 45 years? They are more than 15 billion miles away and still sending valuable information. The picture on the right was taken by one of them. That tiny dot you can see in it is our planet Earth.</p>
